GEOG 576 Mid Term Project
# üõ∏ UAP Sightings Map

## Overview
**UAP Sightings Map** is an interactive, mobile-optimized web application designed for collecting and visualizing Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings submitted by the public. The application leverages ArcGIS Online and Survey123 for data collection and visualization, styled with a sci-fi inspired theme to enhance user engagement.

This project was developed as part of UW GEOG 576 programming course to demonstrate skills in geospatial web development, user interaction design, and spatial data integration.
